1.Design a model capable of analyzing data and metadata related to each News headline and assigning a category to the headline.
2.Each entry has a news headline and a category among other features (provided below).
3.The model thus trained should be able to generalize to a set of not-yet annotated News Headlines: The model is expected to guess the correct News Headline category of data not necessarily belonging to the same source of the News Headlines dataset.
4.You are given a dataset that contains more than 200k labeled news headlines.
5.Your task is to identify the category of a news headline from a fixed category set. Add the output to the root git f6.older given.
6.The predictions validation metric will be the F1-score.

The training set contains 202,372 records.

Each json record contains the following attributes:

id: ID of the News Headline.

category: Category of the News Headline.

headline: The News headline.
